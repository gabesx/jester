Getting Started
Install Jest using yarn:

`yarn add --dev jest`

Or npm:

`npm install --save-dev jest`

Note: Jest documentation uses yarn commands, but npm will also work. You can compare yarn and npm commands in the yarn docs, here.

Let's get started by writing a test for a hypothetical function that adds two numbers. First, create a sum.js file:

`function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;`

Then, create a file named sum.test.js. This will contain our actual test:

`const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});`

Add the following section to your package.json:

{
"scripts": {
"test": "jest"
}
}

Finally, run yarn test or npm run test and Jest will print this message:

PASS  ./sum.test.js
âœ“ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (5ms)

You just successfully wrote your first test using Jest!

This test used expect and toBe to test that two values were exactly identical. To learn about the other things that Jest can test, see Using Matchers.

You didn't specify which testing framework you're using such as Jest or Mocha.

In case of Jest, add this in your package.json:
``"scripts" : {
"test" : "jest"
}``
